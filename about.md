I'm a student in the [Master of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) program](https://onlinelearning.seas.upenn.edu/mcit/) at the University of Pennsylvania.

Previously, I studied Philosophy at the University of Arizona where I wrote my honors thesis advised by [Richard Healey](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rhealey/). There, I was also a member of the [Computational Medicine and Informatics Collaboratory](https://com-in.collab.arizona.edu/).

You can view my CV [here](/vicera_cv.pdf).

I also run a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjk3q6_JrHveu8SyT1legmg).
