I'm a student in the [Master of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT)](https://onlinelearning.seas.upenn.edu/mcit/) program at the University of Pennsylvania. Previously, I studied Philosophy at the University of Arizona where I was also a member of the [Computational Medicine and Informatics Collaboratory](https://com-in.collab.arizona.edu/).

I'm also on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/c/cedricvicera).
