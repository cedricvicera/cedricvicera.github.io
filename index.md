I’m a Master's student in [Computer Science](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/) at the University of Pennsylvania.

Previously, I studied [Philosophy](https://philosophy.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona and did research at the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/), [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/), and the [Computational Medicine and Informatics Collaboratory](https://com-in.collab.arizona.edu/).

I also make videos documenting my life and career on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/c/cedricvicera).
