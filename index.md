Iâ€™m a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I primarily work in health data science, with previous projects ranging from acute respiratory failure to the gut microbiome.

I also make videos documenting my student life on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/c/cedricvicera).
