I’m a [Master of Computer and Information Technology](https://onlinelearning.seas.upenn.edu/mcit/) student at the University of Pennsylvania. Previously, I studied Philosophy at the University of Arizona where I was a member of the [Computational Medicine and Informatics Collaboratory](https://com-in.collab.arizona.edu/).

This summer, I’m a research intern at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments-divisions/biostatistics.html).

I also make videos documenting my student life on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/c/cedricvicera).
