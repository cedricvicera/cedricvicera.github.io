Iâ€™m a Master's student in [Computer Science](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I work in the [Computational Social Science Lab](https://css.seas.upenn.edu/) with [Duncan Watts](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/people/faculty/duncan-j-watts-phd).

Previously, I studied [Philosophy](https://philosophy.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona and did research at [St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/).

I also make videos documenting my career on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/c/cedricvicera).
