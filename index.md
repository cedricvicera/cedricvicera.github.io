Iâ€™m a Master's student in [Computer Science](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I primarily work in biomedical data science, with previous projects from critical care to gut microbiome analysis.

I also make videos documenting my student life on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/c/cedricvicera).
