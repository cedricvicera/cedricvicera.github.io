I study Philosophy at the University of Arizona. I'm primarily interested in philosophy of science. I’m writing an honors thesis advised by [Richard Healey](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~rhealey/).

Currently, I’m a research assistant in the [Computational Medicine and Informatics Collaboratory](https://com-in.collab.arizona.edu/) and the [University of Arizona Genetics Core](https://uagc.arl.arizona.edu/). In addition, I’m a head section leader in the [School of Information](https://ischool.arizona.edu/) where I teach introductory Python programming.
