Iâ€™m a [Master of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT)](https://onlinelearning.seas.upenn.edu/mcit/) student at the University of Pennsylvania. There, I am studying computer science foundations and data science applications. Previously, I studied at the University of Arizona where I received my B.A. (*Honors*) in Philosophy and was a member of the [Computational Medicine and Informatics Collaboratory](https://com-in.collab.arizona.edu/).

This summer I will be a research intern in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments-divisions/biostatistics.html) at [St Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/) as part of their [Pediatric Oncology Education Program](https://www.stjude.org/education-training/predoctoral-training/internships/pediatric-oncology-education-poe-program.html).

I also make videos documenting my student life on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/c/cedricvicera).
