Iâ€™m a [Master of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT)](https://onlinelearning.seas.upenn.edu/mcit/) student and Teaching Assistant at the University of Pennsylvania. There, I am studying computer science foundations and data science applications. Previously, I studied Philosophy at the University of Arizona where I was also a member of the [Computational Medicine and Informatics Collaboratory](https://com-in.collab.arizona.edu/).

I also make videos about education on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/c/cedricvicera).
