I’m a Master's student in [Computer Science](https://onlinelearning.seas.upenn.edu/mcit/) at the University of Pennsylvania. Previously, I studied Philosophy at the University of Arizona.

I’m interested in machine learning, complex systems, and epistemology.

I also make videos documenting my student life on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/c/cedricvicera).
