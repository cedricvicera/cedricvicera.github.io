I’m a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I primarily work in biomedical data science, with previous projects focusing on critical care to gut microbiome analysis.

I also make videos documenting my student life on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/c/cedricvicera).
