Introduction

### Consumerism and the Hopes for Globalism
Fukuyama observes that changes in popular consumerism are beginning to change in addition to intellectual culture.

"But this phenomenon extends beyond high politics and it can be seen also in the ineluctable spread of consumerist Western culture in such diverse contexts [...]" (Fukuyama, 1989).

Fukuyama recalls how audacious it may have been quite outrageous to listen to Alexandre Kojève's proclamation of the end of history. He then provides an explanation of how he may have come to that conclusion (i.e. crash course on Hegelian idealism). Yet today we also find ourselves stunned at how Fukuyama could have made a proclamation for his time and we begin to find explanations on how to comprehend how that could have happened. Here, there is some sense of irony. We could even extend this back to Hegel's proclamation of the end of history due to the Battle of Jena (1806). To say that history has ended is to say that the evolution of ideas have ended.

"We might summarize the content of the universal homogenous state as liberal democracy in the political sphere combined with easy access to VCRs and stereos in the economic." (Fukuyama, 1989).
