title: 'Globalization: Prophecy vs. History'

### Introduction
This is the first of several posts on [GERMAN 270: Sovereignty and the Limits of Globalization and Technology](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5677718-Thiel-German-270-Syllabus.html) taught by Russell Berman and Peter Thiel. This post focuses on declarations of the end of the history and the case of recent globalization.

### Consumerism and the Hopes for Globalization
Francis Fukuyama observes that changes in popular consumerism are beginning to change in addition to intellectual culture.

"But this phenomenon extends beyond high politics and it can be seen also in the ineluctable spread of consumerist Western culture in such diverse contexts [...]" (Fukuyama, 1989).

Fukuyama recalls how audacious it may have been quite outrageous to listen to Alexandre Koj√®ve's proclamation of the end of history. He then provides an explanation of how he may have come to that conclusion (i.e. crash course on Hegelian idealism). Yet today we also find ourselves stunned at how Fukuyama could have made a proclamation for his time and we begin to find explanations on how to comprehend how that could have happened. Here, there is some sense of irony. We could even extend this back to Hegel's proclamation of the end of history due to the Battle of Jena (1806). To say that history has ended is to say that the evolution of ideas have ended.

"We might summarize the content of the universal homogenous state as liberal democracy in the political sphere combined with easy access to VCRs and stereos in the economic." (Fukuyama, 1989).

### A Prophecy of Success Towards a History of Failure
Kishore Mahbubani's *Has the West Lost It?* reminds us that "The End of History?" is actually a return to History. For Mahbubani, Fukuyama is responsible for putting the West to sleep as the rest of the world (especially China and India) woke up. 2001 is known for the September 11 attacks. But what many people forgot to notice was that it was also the year that China became a member of the World Trade Organization.
