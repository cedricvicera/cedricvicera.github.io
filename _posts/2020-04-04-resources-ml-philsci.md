title: 'Resources on Machine Learning and Philosophy of Science'
---
Here are some resources that I find interesting on research interacting between machine learning and philosophy of science. This is mix of historical and current research. I expect that this will be updated.

## Machine Learning Explanation
[Robustness in Machine Learning Explanations: Does It Matter?](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/16686/1/sample-authordraft.pdf), Leif Hancox-Li (2020).

## Machine Learning as Philosophy of Science
[Introduction: Machine Learning as Philosophy of Science](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FB%3AMIND.0000045986.90956.7f), Kevin B. Korb (2004).

## Values in Science
[Value-laden Disciplinary Shifts in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.01172v1.pdf), Ravit Dotan & Smitha Milli (2020).
