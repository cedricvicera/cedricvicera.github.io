title: 'Resources on Machine Learning and Philosophy of Science'
---
Here are some resources that I find interesting on research interacting between machine learning and philosophy of science. This is mix of historical and current research. I expect that this will be updated.

## Articles

[Philosophical Aspects of Pattern Recognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/pattern-recognition-letters/vol/64), Edited by Marcello Pelillo (2015).

[Robustness in Machine Learning Explanations: Does It Matter?](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/16686/1/sample-authordraft.pdf), Leif Hancox-Li (2020).

[Transparency in Complex Computational Systems](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/16669/), Kathleen Creel (2019).
