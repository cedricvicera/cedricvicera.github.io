title: 'Resources on Machine Learning and Philosophy of Science'
---
Here are some resources that I find interesting on research interacting between machine learning and philosophy of science. This is mix of historical and current research. I expect that this will be updated.

## Articles
### General & Introduction
A general introduction to work on machine learning and philosophy of science.
- [Deep Learning: A Philosophical Introduction](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/16326/), Cameron Buckner (2019).
